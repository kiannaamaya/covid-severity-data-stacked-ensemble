# Predicting COVID-19 Severity using Clinical, Proteomic, and Metabolomic Data

This project undertakes the challenge of using diverse data types - clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic - to predict the severity of COVID-19 cases.

## Project Overview:

1. **Data:** The data consists of clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic inputs gathered from COVID-19 patients. These diverse datasets offer a multifaceted view of the disease and.

3. **Methodology:** 
   - **Individual Models:** Three separate models have been developed for each data type: a proteomic model, a clinical model, and a metabolomic model.
   - **Stacking Ensemble Model:** A unique approach was taken to combine the insights from all three individual models. Using data-specific stacking, an ensemble model was created to capitalize on the strengths of each of the separate models.
